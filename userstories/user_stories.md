# The Developer

Hello, my name is Jim.  I have recently started working as a Javascript developer.  I have a high interest in materializing people's ideas into a working model on the web, one that will satisfy their operational needs as well as they envision it.  I became involved in coding after seeing my wife struggle to build the massive administrative paperwork involved for her clients.  Due to how time intensive that part of the job is, she would often miss out on new potential cases.  
She tried hiring a secretary to help her out, but due to the repetetive tasks, more mistakes were made, costing thousands of dollars.
I learned that most forms contained various repetetive fields and figured that there might be some software that would do this automatically.
There wasn't.  Not for anything less that a couple of thousand dollars a month.  I decided to learn coding in order to provide her with an interactive form that would prevent new clients for missing vital information and also streamline the process without her having to constantly proofread.

It was a success and I have since developed a keen interest in the field.

Hello, my name is Jake.  Due to the rising costs in homes in Tacoma, I determined I needed a job north of the county line; a job in the higher-paying city of Seattle!!  While the job pays well and meets my financial expectations, I found myself loosing money in gas.  When you drive one hour north and south every day, even a gas efficient car will create a serious monthly expense.  Luckily, I have discovered the use of the bus!!!  I cannot emphasize how much more economical my life has become.  However, .  . . the amoung of time spent on the bus doing nothing has taken a toll on my boredom.  When I heard about this new start-up project that would provide the bus riders with something to look at while sitting in the bus, I figured it would be nice.  When I heard I could take part in deciding what products to provide, I was super excited.  I have some great ideas of what to add in this catalog.

# Marketing Team Member 1
Hi there, my name is Evelyn. I have worked in Marketing for three years, ever since I left the airforce, where I was a Communications Liason Officer.  I love my job, and as with anyting, marketing can be a path to much success or a sword that cuts you at your knees.  
I have ran the marketing department of various fortune 500 companies which have greatly benefitted the bottom line.  After much consideration, I have decided that I want to use my talent for start up companies.  The BusMall project will be very challenging, but with the right focus, and the right data, we can definitely bring this to life.

I'm Karla.  With a "K".
I am a model who loves to travel and shop!  One of the things I love the most about traeling by plane has always been the Air-Mall because it reminds me of my father who used to be a pilot for a major airline.  Well, that, and also the fact that shopping in the Air Mall gives me a sense of exclusivity.  When people ask "Where did you get this?" I think to myself, "Not at Fred Meyer!".

Due to a long gig I have just picked up, I will be spending a lot of time in Seattle.  While I like the city, I detest driving and it just so happens that I like living in an area that has a nice mixture of nature and metropolis, and I have found just the right place, and it is about 1.5hrs away from Seattle.  As fate would have it, spending time in the bus is not issue for me, and having the ability to shop around while there just makes my trip fun.  I jumped at the opportunity to partucipate in this!
